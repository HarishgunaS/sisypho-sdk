# Chrome Extension Navigation Fixes

## Problem Description

The original Chrome extension had issues with connection robustness during page navigation. When users clicked on links that reloaded the page or navigated to new pages, the connection between the content script, background script, and MCP server would break, causing the `retrieve_write_interaction_queue` tool to stop working.

## Root Causes

1. **Content Script Lifecycle**: When pages reload or navigate, content scripts are destroyed and recreated, but the reconnection logic wasn't robust enough.

2. **Message Queueing**: Messages sent to content scripts during navigation could be lost if the content script wasn't ready to receive them.

3. **Connection State Management**: The background script didn't properly track which content scripts were ready to receive messages.

4. **Interaction Queue Persistence**: The interaction queue could be lost during page transitions due to timing issues.

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Background Script Improvements (`background.js`)

- **Message Queueing System**: Added a `pendingMessages` map to queue messages for tabs that aren't ready yet
- **Tab State Tracking**: Enhanced tab state management with a `ready` flag to track when content scripts are fully initialized
- **Robust Message Forwarding**: Messages are now queued for tabs that aren't ready and sent when they become ready
- **Better Connection Recovery**: Improved reconnection logic with proper state management

### 2. Content Script Improvements (`content.js`)

- **Registration Retry Logic**: Added exponential backoff retry for content script registration with the background script
- **Connection State Tracking**: Added `isRegistered` flag and retry counters for better state management
- **Enhanced WS Class**: Improved the WebSocket client class with better reconnection logic and message queuing
- **Robust Lifecycle Management**: Better handling of page unload and visibility change events

### 3. Manifest Improvements (`manifest.json`)

- **Early Execution**: Set `run_at: "document_start"` to ensure content script loads as early as possible
- **Frame Control**: Set `all_frames: false` to prevent duplicate content scripts in iframes

### 4. Missing Class Definitions

- **RPCError Class**: Added proper error handling class for MCP protocol
- **RPCResponse Class**: Added response class for MCP protocol

## Key Features

### Message Queueing

```javascript
// Messages are queued for tabs that aren't ready
function queueMessageForTab(tabId, message) {
  if (!pendingMessages.has(tabId)) {
    pendingMessages.set(tabId, []);
  }
  pendingMessages.get(tabId).push(message);
}
```

### Registration Retry Logic

```javascript
// Exponential backoff retry for registration
if (registrationRetries < maxRegistrationRetries) {
  registrationRetries++;
  const delay = Math.min(1000 * Math.pow(2, registrationRetries - 1), 10000);
  setTimeout(registerWithBackground, delay);
}
```

### Connection Recovery

```javascript
// Robust reconnection with exponential backoff
_requestReconnection() {
  if (this._reconnectAttempts >= this._maxReconnectAttempts) {
    return;
  }
  this._reconnectAttempts++;
  const delay = Math.min(1000 * Math.pow(2, this._reconnectAttempts - 1), 10000);
  // ... reconnection logic
}
```

## Testing

### Test Page

A test page (`test_navigation.html`) has been created to verify the fixes:

1. **Connection Status**: Check if the MCP extension is connected
2. **Navigation Tests**: Test page reload, new page navigation, and same-page navigation
3. **Interaction Tests**: Test clicks, input, and form submissions
4. **MCP Tool Tests**: Test the `retrieve_write_interaction_queue` and `getInteractionQueueSize` tools

### How to Test

1. Load the extension in Chrome
2. Open `test_navigation.html` in a tab
3. Click "Check Connection" to verify the extension is working
4. Perform various navigation tests:
   - Click "Test Page Reload" to test page refresh
   - Click "Test New Page Navigation" to test navigation to a new site
   - Click "Test Same Page Navigation" to test hash changes
5. Test interactions and MCP tools
6. Verify that the connection remains stable and tools continue to work

### Expected Behavior

- Connection should remain stable during page navigation
- Interaction queue should persist across page reloads
- MCP tools should continue to work after navigation
- Reconnection should happen automatically if connection is lost
- No data should be lost during page transitions

## Monitoring

The extension includes comprehensive logging to help debug issues:

- Background script logs connection status and message forwarding
- Content script logs registration attempts and connection state
- Console messages show when messages are queued and processed

## Performance Considerations

- Message queueing prevents message loss but adds minimal overhead
- Exponential backoff prevents excessive reconnection attempts
- Debounced storage saves reduce I/O operations
- Health checks run every 10 seconds to detect connection issues

## Future Improvements

1. **Persistent Storage**: Consider using IndexedDB for larger interaction queues
2. **Connection Pooling**: Support multiple MCP server connections
3. **Compression**: Compress interaction data to reduce storage usage
4. **Metrics**: Add telemetry to track connection stability and performance
